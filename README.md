The project can now be ran in eclipse

Should the user cause an error by entering a wrong format of required information, there is a line of code that can be uncommented to allow the program to restart

Additionally the progam connects to a database according to a string of information

This consists of the port, database name, username and password

The program also assumes that a table named students does not already exist in the database

If a table does exist with the same name, simply uncomment the same line of code you would after an error in order to drop it first before attempting to create a new one with the base initiallized data
